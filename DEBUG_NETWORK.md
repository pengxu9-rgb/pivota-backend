# 🔍 Network Debug Information

## Problem Analysis

Your symptoms:
- ✅ Manual `fetch()` in console works: returns in ~2 seconds
- ❌ Frontend `axios` requests timeout after 10 seconds
- ❌ Test page buttons not responding

## Root Cause

**Axios timeout issue** - The requests are taking too long from the React app

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Increased Timeout
- Changed from 10 seconds to 30 seconds
- Render free tier can have cold starts

### 2. Switched to Native Fetch
- Created `api-fetch.ts` using native `fetch()` instead of `axios`
- Updated `AuthContext` to use fetch-based API
- Native fetch is more reliable for cross-origin requests

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added timestamps to track request duration
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Better logging for debugging

## What To Do Next

### Step 1: Reload the Frontend
The dev server should auto-reload. If not:
```bash
cd simple_frontend
# Kill the old dev server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open http://localhost:3000/
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to hard reload
3. Or clear cache: F12 → Network tab → Disable cache checkbox

### Step 3: Test Again
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/
2. Try to sign in with:
   - Email: `admin@pivota.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Watch the console for timing logs

### Step 4: Check Console Output
You should now see:
```
🔐 Attempting signin with: {email: "admin@pivota.com"}
⏰ Starting signin request at: 2025-10-15T...
🔐 [FETCH] Attempting signin: {email: "admin@pivota.com", url: "..."}
📥 [FETCH] Response status: 200
✅ [FETCH] Signin successful: {...}
✅ Signin response received at: 2025-10-15T...
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Timing Out

**Test 1: Check if Render is sleeping**
```bash
curl https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/
```
Should respond in < 3 seconds. If slower, the backend might be waking up.

**Test 2: Test from your machine specifically**
```bash
time curl -X POST https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@pivota.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

Expected time: < 3 seconds  
If > 10 seconds → Your network/ISP might be slow to Render's servers

**Test 3: Check if it's a browser issue**
1. Open browser console
2. Paste this:
```javascript
console.time('Manual Test');
fetch('https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/auth/signin', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({email: 'admin@pivota.com', password: 'admin123'})
})
.then(r => {
  console.timeEnd('Manual Test');
  return r.json();
})
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error)
```

Expected: "Manual Test: XXXms" where XXX < 5000

### If Test Page Buttons Not Responding

This means JavaScript isn't loading properly.

**Check:**
1. F12 → Console → Any errors?
2. F12 → Sources tab → Is test-api.html loaded?
3. Try opening directly: http://localhost:3000/test-api.html

**If buttons still don't work:**
The test page might not be in the right location.

```bash
cd simple_frontend
ls -la public/
```

Should show: `test-api.html` and `react-test.html`

## Network Performance Issues

### Possible Causes:
1. **Render Cold Start** - Free tier sleeps after 15min inactivity
2. **Geographic Distance** - Render server might be far from you
3. **ISP Routing** - Your ISP might have slow routes to Render
4. **Browser Extensions** - Ad blockers, VPNs can slow requests
5. **Antivirus/Firewall** - Scanning HTTPS traffic

### Solutions:
1. **Wake up Render first**
   - Visit https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/ in a browser
   - Wait for it to load (might take 10-30 seconds first time)
   - Then try your app again

2. **Disable browser extensions**
   - Try in Incognito/Private mode
   - No extensions = no interference

3. **Check your network**
   ```bash
   ping -c 5 pivota-dashboard.onrender.com
   traceroute pivota-dashboard.onrender.com
   ```

## Current Status

- ✅ Fixed: Increased timeout to 30 seconds
- ✅ Fixed: Switched from axios to native fetch
- ✅ Fixed: Better error handling
- ⏳ Testing: Waiting for you to reload and test

## What I Need From You

1. **Did the page reload automatically?**
   - Check the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
   - Should show "page reload src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx"

2. **Try signing in again**
   - Email: admin@pivota.com
   - Password: admin123
   - What happens?

3. **Check console logs**
   - Do you see the timing logs (⏰ Starting signin request at...)?
   - How long between "Starting" and "received"?
   - If it times out, what's the exact error message?

4. **Test the backend wake-up**
   Open https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/ in a new browser tab
   - Does it load quickly (< 3 seconds)?
   - Or slow (10-30 seconds)?

If Render is sleeping, that's the issue. First request wakes it up (30+ seconds), then it's fast.
