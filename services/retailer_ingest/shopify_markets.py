"""source = "shopify_markets": sibling offers in a SERVED market's currency for a Shopify storefront whose base
currency is another, proven per session. US (USD siblings) since 2026-09-26; SG (SGD siblings) since 2026-10-10.

Multi-market storefronts ADR, Phase 2 (approved by Peng 2026-09-26): "Allow USD offers from non-USD
stores that show US buyers USD prices, but only when the store's cart confirms USD for a US session --
brand stores first." This is `scripts/capture_us_market_offers.py`'s mechanics (lines 19-24, 447-462)
as a retailer_ingest source, scoped to ONE (storefront, brand) job instead of the no_us_offer cohort.

THE EVIDENCE STANDARD, in order, per job (ADR section 3.3):
  1. `/meta.json` `ships_to_countries` names US (the store's own declared reach). A USD base store is
     refused too: its /products.json crawl already IS its US offer (source = storefront).
  2. POST `/localization` as MULTIPART with `_method=put`, `country_code=US`, in a cookie session (a
     urlencoded POST without `_method` silently no-ops; probed 2026-08-14).
  3. `/cart.js` in that session reports `currency == "USD"` BEFORE any price is read. Anything else is a
     clean refusal: a recorded reason, no rows.
  4. `/products/<handle>.js` read inside the same session; `/cart.js` is re-checked every
     SESSION_RECHECK_EVERY products and once at the end, and a check that no longer reports USD voids
     the whole capture (the .js payload carries no currency, so a decayed session could only ever be
     caught out of band).
A `?country=US` query is never evidence (ADR section 1.3: it moved prices at 5 of 30 stores, the
payload has no currency field, and an unmoved number proves nothing), so this module never sends one.

THE TARGET MARKET (Peng 2026-10-10, "Build the SG currency support"): the job's options.market picks it,
from CAPTURE_MARKETS. Everything above reads with the market substituted -- ships_to names SG, the PUT says
country_code=SG, /cart.js must report SGD -- and the sibling is (market 'SG', currency 'SGD', source_system
'shopify_markets_sg_localization', offer id under 'offer:shopify_markets_sg:'). The US capture is byte-
identical to what it was: same source_system, same offer-id prefix and digest, same outcomes and reasons.
Measured motivation (coverage wave 2026-10-10, laptop probe of /cart.js?country=SG -- a lead, not this
module's evidence): many (brand, store) pairs for SG buyers sit at Shopify stores whose base is not SGD
but whose cart quotes SGD to SG (mostly USD- and JPY-base, nearly all of them retailers).

RETAILER STORES (the ADR phase was "brand stores first"): a retailer capture is allowed for SG only
(pipeline.validate_options). Its candidates are narrowed to the rows a RETAILER storefront crawl writes --
`ext:retailer:` listing keys, one per (host, URL) -- whose brand is one the job's cohort selects (the job's
brand, each vendor, the multi_brand `brands` spellings, and each vendor's measured family spelling:
_cohort_brand_keys). The seller is still read from the base offer (merchant_id, offer_type, offer_mode):
a retailer's sibling is that retailer's redirect offer, never a brand-direct one. And because a retailer's
base crawl in a SERVED market (a USD store's US job) already made it a seller there, the capture refuses
a retailer whose /meta.json does not ship to its base offers' served market: those base rows are a seller
claim the store does not back, and a human must retire them first (`base_market_not_shipped`).

IDENTITY COMES FROM THE BASE-CURRENCY CRAWL, never from the capture. Candidates are the live offers a
retailer_ingest crawl of THIS storefront already wrote (source_system catalog_enrichment_agent_v1,
priced in the store's base currency, on this brand's products); each captured price becomes a SIBLING
row beside its base offer -- same product, same SKU, same destination URL, same seller identity --
`(source_domain, market='US', currency='USD', source_system='shopify_markets_us_localization')`. The
base offer is never modified (ADR-024: sibling offers, never rewrites; no FX ever). A product the base
crawl never wrote is never created here. So the operator order per store is: a base-currency crawl job
(market=AU, require_currency=AUD; rows land stored and unservable), THEN this job. For SG the base crawl
is the store's base-currency market's storefront job: market US for a USD store (served: those rows are
its US offer), market JP for a JPY store (acquisition: stored, not served). A CAD/GBP/KRW store has no
ingest market for its base crawl (pipeline.INGEST_MARKETS), so it cannot be captured for SG yet.

POLITENESS. Same UA and the same per-host gate as the /products.json crawl (services.crawl_politeness:
per-host interval, robots.txt, 429/503 backoff). A 429/5xx stops the stage and retries it later on the
lane's backoff, like a throttled crawl. A 403, a non-JSON answer where JSON is due (a bot wall), or a
redirect to another host is UNVERIFIABLE: the job fails with that reason, nothing is written, and
nothing is retried or worked around.

ROBOTS.TXT IS OBEYED FOR EVERY PATH, the two session endpoints included (Peng's standing rule: never scrape
around a crawler block). Every request goes through crawl_politeness.before_request -- the crawl's own
parser, cache and fail-open policy (a robots.txt that 404s, 5xxs or times out is "no restrictions"; only an
explicit Disallow blocks) -- with no special case. And BEFORE the first request to the store, the capture
asks the same gate about SESSION_PATHS (/localization, /cart.js): if the store disallows either for our user
agent, the capture is refused whole (status `nothing`, reason `robots_disallowed:<path>`, no sibling
offers), because without both there is no proof of a USD session at all. On a store serving Shopify's
published default this costs nothing: the Help Center ("Editing robots.txt.liquid", 2026-09-26, "some of
the key entries") lists `Disallow: /cart/` -- with the slash, which does not match `/cart.js` -- and no
`/localization` rule.
