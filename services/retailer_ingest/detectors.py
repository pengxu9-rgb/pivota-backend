  * 2026-09-23 k-touch.us: "3CE - TONE UP TINT 40ml" typed `LIP TINT` by the merchant; its own
    description sells it as a tone-up cream for the complexion. Caught only by reading the row.
    -> lip_row_copy_not_about_lips, lip_row_implausible_size, title_contradicts_category.
  * 2026-09-23 k-touch.us: "3CE Soft Matte Lipstick - Warmish Move" carries a rice cleanser's
    pasted description. -> lip_row_copy_not_about_lips.
  * 2026-09-09 limecrime.com: a literal `TEST Product` priced $999,999,999.00 in /products.json.
    -> placeholder_product.
  * 2026-09-26 headandshoulders.com: a "where to buy" brand site pricing EVERY storefront variant at
    1.00 (120 of 120). The drain applied 74 PDPs / 152 offers at $1.00 unflagged: $1.00 clears the
    per-row rule, and the signal is store-wide. Measured the same day over every store this lane has
    written (186 store/currency cohorts, 39,514 offers): headandshoulders.com is the only one whose
    modal price is <= 2.00 at a modal share over 0.22, or whose <= 1.00 share is over 0.20 (next:
    timelybasket.com, 10/46 at 2.00 and 9/46 at 1.00).
    honest.com's storefront carries 125 of 317 variants at 1.00, mostly diapers. -> placeholder_price_store,
    judged over every record the crawl emitted for the job (already scoped to the job's vendors by
    records_for_brand -- not the whole store), before exclusions or a category filter narrow it.
  * Rows the opt-in lip title door placed (#2257) are a per-row BLOCK: unattended, nothing but the
    title vouches for them (review of #2263: "Lipstick Poster" typed "Misc" reaches a lip leaf).

A BLOCK flag holds the job for review; INFO never does. A flag's `key` is stable across runs of
the same cohort (rule + handle), so an approval can accept exactly the flags it looked at.
