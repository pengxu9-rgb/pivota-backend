    # TONER GETS ITS OWN BUCKET, not a slot inside `treat/`. Two reasons, and they agree:
    #
    # 1. INDUSTRY STANDARD. Google Product Taxonomy 5976 and Shopify's standard taxonomy
    #    hb-3-2-9-17 both put `Toners & Astringents` as a DIRECT CHILD of Skin Care — a sibling of
    #    Facial Cleansers, Lotion & Moisturizer, Sunscreen, Skin Care Masks & Peels and Acne
    #    Treatments & Kits. Neither nests it under a treatments node; in both, "treatments",
    #    "masks" and "toners" are three peers.
    # 2. RECALL. PIVOTA-Agent measured it (src/services/beautyTaxonomy.js): folding toner into
    #    `treat/` puts it in one bucket with serum(520) + mask(421) + exfoliant(123), which is the
    #    broad-bucket shape behind the 2026-07-31 junk recall.
    #
    # ⚠️ THIS MATCHES THE GATEWAY ON PURPOSE. PIVOTA-Agent has declared `tone/toner` canonical
    # since 2026-08-04 and its browse leg queries `category_path LIKE 'beauty/skincare/tone/%'`,
    # while this file named `treat/toner` and nothing here could reach the 315 prod rows sitting on
    # the gateway's path. Two taxonomies over one column, each calling the other's rows corrupt.
    # Do not retarget this leaf without changing beautyTaxonomy.js in the same breath.
    # An ACID or PEELING pad is an exfoliant, not a toner. The Toner entry below claims a bare
    # "pad", which is right for the hydrating/soothing pads that dominate the shelf (Anua Heartleaf
    # 77% Toner Pad, Torriden Multi Pad, NEOGEN Real Cica Pad) but wrong for an exfoliating one --
    # measured on sokoglam's "Physical" and "Chemical" shelves, where SOME BY MI "AHA-BHA-PHA 30
    # Days Miracle Truecica Clear Pad" and IOPE "Skin Booster Ampoule Peel Pad" both read as toners.
    # This arm sits ABOVE Toner so first-match-wins reaches it, and it NARROWS nothing: a pad with
    # no acid and no peel noun still falls through to Toner exactly as before. The acid list is the
    # exfoliating acids only -- hyaluronic, azelaic and amino acids are NOT exfoliants, and a title
    # naming an acid without a pad noun is left to the entries below; `lactic` declines "lactic acid
    # BACTERIA ferment", which is a soothing ingredient. "Gauze" is deliberately NOT a noun here:
    # prod holds a "Calming Gauze Pad" (a soothing pad), and NEOGEN's exfoliating gauzes all say
    # "Bio-Peel ... Peeling" anyway. This DOES add a second path to the distinct-path count that
    # services/curated_brand_feed._pattern_matches takes over a merchant product_type: a shelf

#
# A path names a category only once it says something past the top-level domain. `beauty` is a
# NAMESPACE, not an answer to "what is this" -- and treating it as an answer is what stranded an
# entire cohort. Measured on the live index: of 50 rows returned for "eau de parfum", 16 sit on bare
# `beauty`, including the whole Ariana Grande fragrance line, Cosmic Kylie Jenner and every
# PixiPerfume. Serving drops them as `category_mismatch`, and the backfill below never revisits them
# because `category_path IS NULL` reads them as already done. A useless answer counted as an answer
# in both directions at once.
#
# It also explains why the cohort survived a taxonomy standardisation pass: `beauty` IS on the
# taxonomy, so an off-taxonomy health check counts it healthy. Nothing was watching non-leaf paths.
#
# Exported so the backfill, the serving gate and any future writer share one rule rather than each
# re-deciding what "categorised" means. PIVOTA-Agent's serving-side twin is
# `categoryPathIsCategorised` in src/server.js; the drift test below pins them to the same rule.
