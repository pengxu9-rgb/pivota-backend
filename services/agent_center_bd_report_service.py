"""
BD external-merchant AI visibility report — shared service module.

This module owns the pure analysis + report-rendering logic that both
`scripts/agent_center_bd_external_merchant.py` (CLI) and the new
`/api/agent-center/bd/external-merchant-report` HTTP route consume.

Why factor this out:
  - The CLI was the first surface; the BD UI in employee-portal is the
    second. Keeping the verdict thresholds, competitor extraction, and
    report shape in one place avoids drift between the two.
  - The HTTP route returns structured JSON for the UI to render, while
    the CLI renders markdown. Both formats need the same underlying
    analysis — so analysis is here, formatting (markdown vs JSON-for-UI)
    is here too.
  - Tests stay in one place: `tests/test_agent_center_bd_external_merchant.py`
    already covers the analysis functions; route tests just exercise the
    HTTP wrapper.

This module has no DB dependencies — all data comes from `llm_client.probe`
results passed in by the caller.
