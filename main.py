async def root():
    """Service banner, and the SECOND door onto the same honesty guarantee as
    `/health` — so it cannot be the door that stays open.

    This endpoint used to report `"status": "healthy"` and `"health": "OK"` as
    string literals, while the `db_status` field sitting beside them in the very
    same payload said `"disconnected"`. Only `db_status` was ever computed;
    "healthy" was true by construction. Anything reading the status — a monitor,
    a load balancer, a human — got a green answer from a process that could not
    serve a single database-backed request.

    That matters beyond this handler. `/health` was made observe-only and
    503-on-failure precisely so an outage cannot hide behind a green indicator;
    leaving `/` unconditionally healthy would have made that guarantee depend
    on which path the Railway dashboard happens to name. It currently names
    `/health`: a committed Railway API dump (a point-in-time snapshot, not live
    truth) shows nine services set `healthcheckPath` to `/health` and five to
    `null`, none to `/`, with the `api.pivota.cc` service among the nine. So
    this change fixes no active outage — it removes a second door that a single
    dashboard edit could have opened onto the one #1683 closed.

    Two rules hold this together:

    1. OBSERVE, NEVER REPAIR. `probe_database_health` connects nothing and
       resets nothing — if the shared `database` is not connected, that IS the
       answer. It replaces a bare `await database.execute("SELECT 1")`, which
       was a second, weaker copy of the same idiom: no timeout, so a stalled
       backend hung this handler instead of reporting on it. Request-time
       recovery stays in `ensure_database_ready` (auth/quote/order paths) and
       in the unattended supervisor. Reporting the truth does not remove the
       app's ability to heal.
    2. ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Every reported field below derives from `db_ok`.
       The original defect was three fields that were supposed to agree and had
       no mechanism forcing them to; a future edit must not be able to fix one
       and leave another lying.

    Connectivity only, deliberately: `/health` additionally gates on the schema
    guard, and `/` keeps the narrower contract its `db_status` field always
    described.

    Two limits, stated so they are not rediscovered during an incident:

    - THE STATUS CODE IS THE SIGNAL; the body's `status` field is not what a
      client sees on failure. `ErrorHandlerMiddleware` re-nests every >=400
      JSON body, so on 503 this payload moves under `error.details` and the
      top-level `status` reads "error". `db_status` — the only field here that
      predates the fix and was always honest — is therefore ABSENT at the top
      level on 503, where it was previously always present. No consumer of it
      is known (see the commit message's sweep), and `/health` already behaves
      this way; the status code is what survives the envelope intact.
    - A SATURATED POOL READS AS DOWN. `probe_database_health` decides from one
      `SELECT 1` under a timeout, and as `_force_mark_database_disconnected`
      notes, that cannot distinguish a dead pool from a slow or saturated one.
      A load spike on a healthy database will flip `/` to 503. That ambiguity
      is inherited from the primitive and `/health` already carries it; this
      change widens its surface to a second path rather than introducing it.
