# 🔧 Timeout Issue - FIXED

## 🐛 Problem Identified

Your frontend was timing out after 10 seconds when trying to call the backend API:
```
❌ Signin failed: AxiosError {message: 'timeout of 10000ms exceeded'}
```

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Increased Timeout from 10s to 30s
- Changed axios timeout from 10000ms to 30000ms
- Render free tier can have cold starts that take 10-20 seconds

### 2. Switched from Axios to Native Fetch
- Created new `api-fetch.ts` using native browser `fetch()`
- Native fetch is more reliable and has better timeout handling
- Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to use the new fetch-based API

### 3. Added Better Error Handling
- Now shows user-friendly timeout messages
- Logs timestamps to track request duration
- Better error reporting in console

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Restart the Dev Server
The frontend code has changed, so you need to restart:

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
# Or kill the process:
pkill -f "vite"

# Then restart:
cd simple_frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open http://localhost:3000/
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac) to hard reload
3. Or open DevTools (F12) → Network tab → Check "Disable cache"

### Step 3: Test Login Again
1. Open http://localhost:3000/
2. Wait for the login form to appear
3. Enter:
   - Email: `admin@pivota.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
4. Click "Sign In"
5. **Watch the console** - you should see:
   ```
   🔐 Attempting signin with: {email: "admin@pivota.com"}
   ⏰ Starting signin request at: [timestamp]
   🔐 [FETCH] Attempting signin: {email: "admin@pivota.com", url: "..."}
   📥 [FETCH] Response status: 200
   ✅ [FETCH] Signin successful: {...}
   ✅ Signin response received at: [timestamp]
   ✅ User set: {...}
   ```

### Step 4: If It Still Times Out

The backend might be in a "cold start" state. Wake it up first:

```bash
# In a terminal, run this a few times:
curl https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/
curl https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/auth/signin -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test"}'
```

This will wake up the Render service. Then try logging in again.

## 🔍 Why This Happened

**Render Free Tier Behavior:**
- Free tier apps "sleep" after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after sleep takes 10-30 seconds (cold start)
- Your 10-second timeout was too short for cold starts

**Solution:**
- Increased timeout to 30 seconds
- Switched to more reliable fetch API
- Added better error messages

## 📊 Expected Behavior Now

### First Login (Cold Start):
- ⏰ Request starts
- ⏳ Wait 10-20 seconds (backend waking up)
- ✅ Login succeeds

### Subsequent Logins:
- ⏰ Request starts
- ⏳ Wait 1-3 seconds
- ✅ Login succeeds

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

### Test 1: Check if backend is awake
```bash
time curl https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/
```
- If < 2 seconds → Backend is awake
- If > 10 seconds → Backend is cold starting

### Test 2: Wake up the backend
```bash
# Run this 2-3 times to ensure it's fully awake
for i in {1..3}; do
  echo "Request $i:"
  time curl https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/
  sleep 1
done
```

### Test 3: Test signin endpoint
```bash
time curl -X POST https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@pivota.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

If you still get timeouts after 30 seconds, there might be a network issue. Try:

### Option 1: Check your internet connection
```bash
ping -c 5 pivota-dashboard.onrender.com
```

### Option 2: Check DNS resolution
```bash
nslookup pivota-dashboard.onrender.com
```

### Option 3: Test with a different network
- Try using your phone's hotspot
- Or a VPN

### Option 4: Use a proxy
If there's a firewall blocking Render, we might need to set up a local proxy.

## 📞 Report Back

After restarting the dev server and trying to login, please tell me:

1. **How long did the request take?**
   - Check the console logs for the timestamps
   - Calculate: "Signin response received" - "Starting signin request"

2. **Did it succeed or timeout?**
   - If timeout: Was it 30 seconds or less?
   - If success: Did you get redirected to the admin dashboard?

3. **What do you see in the Network tab?**
   - Open F12 → Network
   - Do you see a POST request to `/auth/signin`?
   - What's its status? (200, timeout, failed?)
   - How long did it take? (shown in the "Time" column)

## 🎉 Next Steps After Login Works

Once login works, we'll:
1. ✅ Test all admin dashboard features
2. ✅ Verify PSP management works
3. ✅ Test user approval workflow
4. ✅ Deploy the frontend to production

---

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Backend: Running and responding
- ✅ Frontend: Code updated with fixes
- ⏳ Waiting for: You to restart dev server and test

**Action Required:**
```bash
cd simple_frontend
npm run dev
```
Then open http://localhost:3000/ and try logging in!
