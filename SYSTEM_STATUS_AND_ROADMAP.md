#### ‚úÖ **Fully Operational:**
- **Agent API** (`/agent/v1/*`)
  - Product search with filters
  - Cart validation and pricing
  - Order creation
  - Order status tracking
  - Analytics dashboard

  - Usage tracking and analytics
  - Merchant access control

- **Agent SDK** (`pivota_sdk/pivota_agent.py`)
  - Python SDK for easy integration
  - Auto-retry and error handling
  - Context manager support
  - Quick order functions

- **Order Processing**
  - Order creation and persistence (PostgreSQL)
  - Multi-item orders with shipping address
  - Order status management
  - Order history and stats

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Work (10%):**
- **Fulfillment Tracking**

  - ‚úÖ Tracking number updates
  - ‚ùå Real-time status updates (needs WebSocket or polling)
  - ‚ùå Delivery status notifications to agent

**Fix needed:**
```python
# Add endpoint for agent to track fulfillment
@router.get("/agent/v1/orders/{order_id}/tracking")
async def get_fulfillment_status(order_id: str):
    # Return tracking number, carrier, delivery status
    pass
```

**Estimated time to complete**: 1-2 hours

---

### 2. Agent Onboarding & MCP/API Connections: ‚úÖ **95% READY**

#### ‚úÖ **Fully Operational:**

**Agent Onboarding:**
- `/agents/create` - Create new AI agents
- API key generation and management
- Rate limits and quotas configuration
- Usage analytics
- Agent activation/deactivation

**Merchant Onboarding:**
- `/merchant/onboarding/register` - Register merchants
- Auto-KYB approval for Shopify stores
- Manual KYB review for other platforms
- KYC document upload
- Merchant status management

**PSP Connections:**
- `/merchant/onboarding/psp/setup` - Connect Stripe/Adyen
- Real credential validation
- Merchant-specific API keys
- Payment routing configuration

**MCP (Shopify) Connections:**
- `/integrations/shopify/connect` - Connect Shopify store
- OAuth flow support
- Access token management
- Product sync
- Order creation
- Webhook registration

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Work (5%):**
- **Multi-platform MCP Support**
  - ‚úÖ Shopify fully integrated
  - ‚ùå Wix integration (adapter exists, needs testing)
  - ‚ùå WooCommerce (not implemented)
  - ‚ùå Custom platforms

**Estimated time to add Wix**: 2-3 hours  
**Estimated time to add WooCommerce**: 4-6 hours

---

### 3. AP2 Protocol Integration: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED (0%)**

**What is AP2?**
AP2 (Agent Protocol 2.0) allows agents to:
- Bring their own credentials/tokens
- Checkout directly through MCP server
- Complete payment in merchant's PSP
- All without exposing merchant credentials to the agent

**Current State:**
- ‚ùå No AP2 protocol implementation
- ‚ùå No credential delegation system
- ‚ùå No session-based checkout flow
- ‚ùå No token exchange mechanism

**What Would Be Needed:**

```python
# 1. Agent Session Management
POST /ap2/sessions/create
{
  "agent_id": "agent_xxx",
  "merchant_id": "merch_xxx",
  "customer_token": "encrypted_customer_credentials"
}

# 2. Checkout with Agent Credentials
POST /ap2/checkout
{
  "session_id": "sess_xxx",
  "items": [...],
  "payment_token": "agent_provided_token"
}

# 3. Payment Delegation
- Agent provides payment method token
- MCP server validates with merchant's PSP
- Payment processed without exposing PSP keys
- Agent gets confirmation

# 4. Security Layer
- Token encryption/decryption
- Scope-limited permissions
- Audit trail for all operations
- PCI compliance considerations
```

**Architecture Needed:**
```
Agent with Customer Token
    ‚Üì
AP2 Session Create (Pivota)
    ‚Üì
Encrypted Token Storage
    ‚Üì
Checkout Request
    ‚Üì
Token Validation with Merchant PSP
    ‚Üì
Payment Processing (Delegated)
    ‚Üì
Order Creation in Shopify
    ‚Üì
Confirmation to Agent
```

**Estimated Development Time**: 5-7 days
**Complexity**: High
**Dependencies**:
- Token encryption/decryption system
- Session management
- Payment token validation
- Security audit

## üéØ CURRENT CAPABILITIES

### What Works Right Now:
1. ‚úÖ Agent can search products across merchants
2. ‚úÖ Agent can create orders with real product data
3. ‚úÖ Stripe processes payments automatically
4. ‚úÖ Shopify receives orders and sends email confirmations
5. ‚úÖ Merchants can track orders via dashboard
6. ‚úÖ Multiple agents can operate concurrently
7. ‚úÖ Rate limiting prevents abuse
8. ‚úÖ Full audit trail of all operations

### What Needs Agent Manual Work:
1. ‚ùå Agent needs to manually check fulfillment status (API exists, just needs to be called)
2. ‚ùå Agent needs to provide customer payment method (can't delegate yet)
3. ‚ùå Agent can't handle refunds (endpoint needed)

### What's Not Possible Yet:
1. ‚ùå AP2 protocol - agent bringing customer credentials
2. ‚ùå Multi-platform product search (only Shopify works)
3. ‚ùå Automatic fulfillment notification to agent

### Q2: Agent Onboarding & MCP/API Connections - Ready?
**Answer**: **95% Ready**
- ‚úÖ Agent registration and API key management
- ‚úÖ Merchant onboarding with auto-KYB
- ‚úÖ Shopify MCP connection fully working

## üéØ RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Option A: Complete Current Flow (Recommended - 1 day)
1. Add fulfillment tracking API for agents
2. Add refund processing
3. Test with 5 different agents concurrently
4. Document the complete API

### Option B: Add AP2 Protocol (1-2 weeks)
1. Design AP2 specification
2. Implement session management
3. Add token delegation
4. Security audit
5. Testing and documentation

### Option C: Multi-Platform Support (3-4 days)
1. Test Wix integration
2. Add WooCommerce
3. Unified product search across platforms
4. Cross-platform order management

---

## üí° MY RECOMMENDATION

**Start with Option A** (Complete Current Flow):
- You already have a working E2E flow
- Adding fulfillment tracking takes 1 day
- Then you have a complete, production-ready system
- AP2 can be Phase 2 once you have customers using the current flow

**Then move to Option C** (Multi-Platform) before Option B (AP2):
- More immediate business value
- Broader merchant appeal
- Easier to implement
- AP2 is complex and may not be needed if agents trust Pivota's security
