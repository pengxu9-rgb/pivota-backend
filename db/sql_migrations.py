"""
Runner for ``db/migrations/*.sql``.

What this replaces: the inline runner in ``main.startup()``, which sent each
file whole through ``conn.execute(text(body))`` on an AUTOCOMMIT connection.
Measured against a clean Postgres on 2026-08-19, **6 of 219 files could never
apply** under it, each rolling back entirely because a file is one
simple-query batch:

1. ``CONCURRENTLY`` (4 files: 051, 059, 132, 135). psycopg2 sends a
   multi-statement string as ONE implicit transaction, so AUTOCOMMIT alone
   does not help — ``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY cannot run inside a
   transaction block``. The ``ALTER TABLE``s that shared those files
   (``catalog_offers.suppression_*``, ``writer_audit_log``, …) never landed
   either.
2. ``text()`` bind parsing (2 files: 191_acp_checkout_sessions,
   192_acp_delegate_allowances). ``text()`` reads ``:name`` as a bind
   parameter **even inside a ``--`` comment** — both files describe a cache
   key like ``acp_complete:<session_id>:a<attempt>`` in prose and die with
   "A value is required for bind parameter 'a'".

An earlier form of that runner (before it moved to AUTOCOMMIT) called
``conn.commit()`` on a legacy SQLAlchemy 1.4 ``Connection``, which has no such
method: every file raised ``AttributeError``, and only files whose text began
with a DDL keyword survived through 1.4 legacy autocommit. That is the history
behind ``relation "webhook_events" does not exist``; it is fixed on main, and
this runner keeps it fixed by using a real transaction per file.

Migration bodies are executed on the raw DBAPI cursor (see ``_execute_raw``),
not through ``text()`` or ``exec_driver_sql`` — both of those mangle static
SQL that contains ``:name`` tokens or literal ``%``. Only the ledger INSERT
is bound.

Applied files are recorded in ``startup_sql_migrations`` so each file runs at most
once per database *through this runner*, in the same transaction as the file
itself: a file that fails leaves no ledger row and is retried on the next
boot, exactly like the old best-effort behaviour. Migration content is
unchanged.

The ledger is deliberately NOT called ``schema_migrations``: production already
has a table of that name, owned by something outside this repo — 71 rows keyed
``id`` (``001_taxonomy.sql``, ``004_look_replicator.sql``, …) with no
``filename``/``checksum`` columns. Using that name made ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT
EXISTS`` a no-op against the foreign table and every ledger INSERT then failed
inside the migration's own transaction, so **all 219 files rolled back**
(reproduced 2026-08-20).

Two independent guards came out of that, because the name alone is not enough
on a database this repo shares with other systems:

* The ledger row is recorded AFTER the migration's transaction commits, never
  inside it (:func:`_record_applied`). A ledger that is unwritable for any
  reason — a view, a missing unique constraint for ``ON CONFLICT``, an extra
  NOT NULL column, no INSERT grant — can then only cost a re-run, never a
  rollback.
* :func:`_ledger_state` decides by READING the columns we use, not by
  comparing information_schema shapes. If a relation of our name exists and we
  cannot read it, the runner REFUSES to run rather than falling back to
  "apply everything": re-running the tree against a populated database
  re-executes convergent writes — ``126_subscription_plans_allowance_rebase``
  resets ``subscription_plans.monthly_credit_allowance``, 139/146 re-tombstone
  catalog rows, ``013`` appends a routing_migration_log row per boot — and
  three files (003, 024, 027) are not re-runnable at all, because
  ``CREATE TRIGGER`` has no ``IF NOT EXISTS`` in PG15.

Note the ledger is not the only applier: ``routes/admin_run_migration_pending``
executes a migration by number and writes no ledger row, so a file applied
that way is applied once more by the next boot. Harmless for the additive
files that route targets today, but if that changes, teach it to write the
ledger row too.

Call this INSIDE the startup advisory lock (see db/startup_ddl.py) so two
instances never apply the same file concurrently.
