"""DB accessors for the retailer ingest pipeline (migration 234).

Unlike db/catalog_onboard_queue.py, nothing here swallows an error: a pipeline whose ledger write
failed silently would report a store as done that never was. Every accessor raises.

Leases, not a reaper: a claim sets `lease_until`, and an expired lease makes the job claimable
again, so a run killed mid-crawl (Cloud Run task timeout, OOM) is retried by the next tick instead
of sitting in a "processing" state nothing ever clears (the gap migration 158 left open).
