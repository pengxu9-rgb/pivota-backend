# 🎉 SUCCESS! Frontend is Working!

## ✅ GREAT NEWS

The **timeout issue is completely fixed!** Your error shows:

```
POST https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/auth/signin 401 (Unauthorized)
Error: Invalid credentials
```

This means:
- ✅ Frontend is making API calls successfully
- ✅ Backend is responding quickly (no timeout!)
- ✅ The only issue is: the user doesn't exist or needs approval

## 🔐 The User Approval Issue

When you signed up `admin@pivota.com`, the system created the user but set `approved: false`.

The response was:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Account created successfully. Awaiting admin approval.",
  "user_id": "c6d36060-88ee-4c7d-9e80-b809f96f0f24",
  "role": "admin",
  "approved": false  ← This is the problem
}
```

## 🛠️ Solution Options

### Option 1: Approve via Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
3. Find the `user_roles` table
4. Find the row with `user_id = c6d36060-88ee-4c7d-9e80-b809f96f0f24`
5. Change `approved` from `false` to `true`
6. Save
7. Try logging in again!

### Option 2: Create a Test User Without Approval

I can modify the backend to auto-approve the first admin user. Would you like me to do this?

### Option 3: Use Supabase SQL Editor

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
UPDATE user_roles 
SET approved = true 
WHERE user_id = 'c6d36060-88ee-4c7d-9e80-b809f96f0f24';
```

## 🎯 Quick Test

Let me know which option you prefer, or:

**Can you access your Supabase dashboard?**
- If YES → Use Option 1 (easiest)
- If NO → I'll modify the backend to auto-approve admins
