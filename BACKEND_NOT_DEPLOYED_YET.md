# ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Not Deployed Yet

## Current Situation

**Frontend**: ‚úÖ Running on http://localhost:3000 with latest code
**Backend**: ‚ùå Still running OLD code (before merchant onboarding)

## Why Merchants Disappear

When you onboard a merchant:
1. ‚úÖ Frontend makes API call to `/merchants/onboard`
2. ‚ùå **Backend doesn't have this endpoint** (old deployment)
3. ‚ùå **Merchant is NOT saved** to database
4. ‚ùå When reloading, merchant doesn't exist

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Wait for Render Deployment (~5-10 min)
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find "pivota-dashboard" service
3. Check if deployment is:
   - üîÑ "Deploying" - Wait for it to complete
   - ‚úÖ "Live" - Check the commit hash matches `99d0d6b`
   - ‚ùå "Failed" - Check logs for errors

### Option 2: Manual Deploy (Force It)
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on "pivota-dashboard"
3. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Clear build cache & deploy"
4. Wait ~5 minutes

### Option 3: Test Locally (Immediate)
Run backend locally to test immediately:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Run backend
cd pivota_infra
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 - Update frontend API URL
# Edit: simple_frontend/src/services/api.ts
# Change: const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';

# Terminal 3 - Frontend already running
# Just refresh the page
```

## How to Verify Backend is Deployed

Check if merchant endpoints exist:

```bash
# Should return merchant list (empty or with data)
curl https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/merchants/

# Should show recent timestamp if deployed
curl https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/health
```

## Current Commits

**On GitHub**: ‚úÖ `99d0d6b` (latest - has merchant system)
**On Render**: ‚ùå Unknown (probably older)

**Expected**: Render should auto-deploy when it detects new commit

## Timeline

- **Pushed to GitHub**: ~15 minutes ago
- **Expected Deploy Time**: 5-10 minutes
- **Total Wait**: Should be ready NOW or very soon

## What to Do NOW

1. **Check Render Dashboard**: See deployment status
2. **If "Live"**: Refresh http://localhost:3000 and test again
3. **If still deploying**: Wait 5 more minutes
4. **If failed**: Check Render logs for errors

**The merchant system WILL work once backend deploys!** üöÄ

All the code is ready, just waiting for Render to deploy it.
