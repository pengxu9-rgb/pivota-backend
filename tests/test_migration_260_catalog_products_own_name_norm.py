"""Shape of migrations 260/261 (catalog_products.name_norm / own_name_norm; PIVOTA-Agent #2404).

The whole point of the column is that it equals what the gateway folds at query time, so the
first pin is the fold EXPRESSION, character for character, against the gateway's `identitySql`
(PIVOTA-Agent src/services/canonicalSearchQualitySql.js). The gateway is another repository, so
the expression is pinned here as the literal the two sides agreed on; a change on either side
has to change this constant, and the Postgres gate (tests/test_catalog_products_own_name_norm_
postgres.py) proves the column equals the expression on real rows.

SQLite-safe: reads files, never a database.
