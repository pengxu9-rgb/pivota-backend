"""Every SQL literal this repo hands to `database.*` must be PLANNABLE by Postgres.

THE WIDENING. `tests/test_ops_script_sql_prepare_postgres.py` proves the idea on
four ops scripts by DRIVING them. This file takes the other half: a static sweep
over every `database.<method>("...")` call site in the repo, asking Postgres to
PREPARE each one. The two are complementary and neither subsumes the other —

    driven   sees `.format()`/f-string SQL, but only where a test drives it;
    static   sees every literal call site it can FOLLOW.

Be precise about that second one, because "static sweep" oversells it. MIND THE
UNIT: a CALL SITE is one `database.*(...)` expression, a STATEMENT is one SQL
string handed to PREPARE, and they are not the same number — the loop-over-
literals idiom turns 18 call sites into 181 statements. Both appear below, each
labelled, because an earlier revision of this docstring compared one against the
other and so reported a blind spot 3.6x smaller than it is.

Of 3,681 call sites in the swept directories this collector resolves 2,527, which
expand to 2,690 statements: literals, module-level constants, loop-over-literals,
lambda bodies, a literal assigned to a FUNCTION-LOCAL name, one passed by
KEYWORD, and one wrapped in `text(...)`. Those last three were the biggest blind
spot this file had, and closing them took the sweep from 2,232 collected / 2,090
planned to 2,690 / 2,503.

WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE, in CALL SITES, measured, so nobody has to infer it from
a green run:

    475  SQLAlchemy Core constructs (`table.select()`, `.insert().values()`).
         NOT raw SQL and out of scope by construction — they are compiled for the
         dialect and cannot carry this defect class at all.
    424  a NAME this collector will not follow. Broken down, because most are not
         recoverable and it matters which: 210 bound once to a non-literal (an
         f-string one hop away), 99 bound repeatedly with differing values, 48
         bound opaquely (a parameter, a loop or `with` target, an except name),
         41 not bound in this scope at all. Only 26 are declined purely by the
         one-binding rule's conservatism — see `_local_literal_sql` for why that
         rule is worth those 26.
    239  f-strings, `.format()` and concatenation. Most are genuinely dynamic: a
         WHERE clause joined from a list of conditions, an interpolated
         identifier. A minority are dialect splits or optional-field SETs, and
         those CAN be made static — `if IS_POSTGRES:` over module-level
         constants, or `COALESCE(:param, column)`. See
         db/product_quality_backfill_jobs.py for both patterns done, and
         services/pdp_governance_service.py for the case where NO split is needed
         because `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` is portable.
     16  a helper call returning SQL, or a shape none of the above describes.

The function-local rule is deliberately strict — exactly one binding, and a
function parameter counts as a binding. Resolving the WRONG SQL for a call site
is worse than resolving none, because it PASSES a statement nobody looked at.
See `_local_literal_sql`.

WHY IT PAYS. The first sweep found NINE statements that cannot be planned, all
in code shipped since May 2026 and all fixed in the commit that adds this file:
three in the `catalog_sync_service` tombstone prune (#1703's own defect, in a
live sync path), one in `pdp_matcher`, two `products_cache` backfills, one in
`subject_resolve`, one in `commerce_attribution_service`, and a `jsonb`-into-
`json` COALESCE in `routes/buyer_api.py` that sits inside `except Exception:
pass`. That is the #1588 story again: the repo's tests run on SQLite, and SQLite
cannot see any of it.

AND THE LIMIT THIS GATE CANNOT CROSS, learned by tripping over it. PREPARE is
Parse+Describe: it validates TYPES, never VALUES. Three of those nine statements
were still dead after being made plannable — they had moved from failing at Parse
to failing at Bind (a `Decimal` bound to a param the CASE typed `integer`; a raw
`dict` bound to a `json` column through raw SQL, where no SQLAlchemy bind
processor runs). A green run here means "Postgres would plan this", not "this
works". The driven gate can see bind-time failures; this one structurally cannot.

THE FIXTURE IS THE WHOLE BALLGAME. PREPARE resolves names against a real schema,
so what this gate can see is bounded by what the schema has. Each layer bought
real coverage, of 1,954 collected statements:

    metadata.create_all only .................  751 planned
    + db/migrations/*.sql .................... 1,518 planned
    + main.py's startup DDL .................. 1,790 planned
    + isolated from `public` ................. 1,826 planned
    + private database, UTF8 client ......... 1,835 planned,  122 unchecked

(Those are the numbers from when the fixture was built, against the 1,954
statements the collector could then resolve. It plans 2,500 of 2,690 today; the
fixture did not change, the collector did.)

Note what "planned" does and does not prove: ~500 of these are utility statements
(CREATE/ALTER/DROP), for which Postgres does no name or type analysis at Parse.
They always plan — with one exception worth knowing, since it also bounds the
multi-command exemption below: a CREATE that CARRIES a query (`CREATE TABLE ... AS
SELECT`, `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`) does get that query analysed. The number
that carries weight is the ~2,000 DML statements.

The 3 `stale_catalog_*` stubs matter for the same reason — they are TEMP tables
the sync prune creates at runtime, and without them three genuinely-broken
statements in `services/catalog_sync_service.py` fail with `UndefinedTable` and
get written off as a fixture gap. A fixture hole does not just lose coverage, it
MASKS defects, which is why the unchecked count is pinned below rather than
merely reported.

🚨 THIS GATE DOES NOT SHARE A DATABASE AT ALL. It creates one, builds the schema
in it, and drops it. Applying 220 migrations — 118 of which ALTER or UPDATE — to
the database every other `test_*_postgres.py` file shares is exactly the blast
radius the warning in tests/test_canonical_feed_tombstoned_flag_postgres.py
describes, an order of magnitude up. A private SCHEMA was tried first and is not
sufficient in either direction; see the comment on `_GATE_DB`.

# BE HONEST ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF ERROR. Over-inclusion (catching a CTE name, a
# LATERAL keyword, an alias) does not invent a false failure — but it does add an
# unknown name to `named`, which then cannot be a subset of `faithful`, which
# demotes a genuine column defect back to "unchecked". So over-inclusion HIDES
# defects. It is the safe direction for CI noise and the unsafe one for coverage;
# both halves are stated here because the first version of this comment claimed
# only the first and was used to justify not caring.
#
# Known escapes, measured: a CTE (`WITH c AS (...)`) contributes `c`; a statement
# with no FROM at all yields an empty `named` and is excluded by the `named and`
# guard in the classifier. Each is a statement this gate does not column-check.
#
# `set` and `skip` earn their place here for a reason worth spelling out,
# because it is the over-inclusion hazard above happening for real rather than in
# principle. The regex below matches `UPDATE`, and two very common clauses put a
# keyword straight after it:
#
#     ON CONFLICT (...) DO UPDATE SET col = ...   -> captured `set`
#     SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED           -> captured `skip`
#
# Neither is in any schema, so `named` could never be a subset of `faithful`, so
# every statement carrying one was quietly demoted out of the wrong-column check.
# The demotion is invisible: a masked statement is reported as "unchecked
# (fixture gap)", which reads like a missing table rather than like a check that
# switched itself off.
#
# MEASURED, and stated precisely because this file's whole culture is measurement
# — an earlier revision of this comment said "83" and "EVERY upsert", and both
# were wrong:
#
#     80   statements captured `set` (of 120 upserts; the 39 spelled
#          `DO NOTHING` have no SET clause and were never affected)
#      7   statements captured `skip`, via FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
#
# Neither was hiding a failing statement when it was fixed — the planned,
# unchecked and column-error counts are identical either way — so both are
# preventive. Not hypothetical, though: the upsert in
# routes/admin_protocol_sync.py, which INSERTs `from_currency, to_currency,
# rate` into a table whose real shape is a `base_currency` + `rates` jsonb
# snapshot, is masked by exactly the `set` token the moment the collector can
# resolve its SQL, and it is a statement that cannot ever have run.

def _local_literal_sql(scope: ast.AST) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """name -> literal, for names bound EXACTLY ONCE in this scope to a string.

    THE BIGGEST BLIND SPOT THIS FILE HAD. `query = "SELECT ..."` on one line and
    `await database.fetch_one(query, ...)` on the next is the single most common
    way this repo writes SQL, and the collector could not follow it: 335 call
    sites, spread across ~150 files at one to sixteen each. They are not dynamic
    SQL. They are ordinary literals one name-binding away from the call.

    #1966 closed this shape in ONE file by inlining the literals at the call
    site. That works, but it does not scale to 150 files and it does not stop the
    blind spot reopening the next time somebody writes the obvious thing. This
    resolves the shape instead, so the coverage is permanent and costs no
    production churn.

    THE ONE-BINDING RULE IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT, and it is deliberately
    stricter than it needs to be. A name is resolved only when this scope binds
    it exactly once, to a string constant. Anything that could make the value at
    the call site differ from the literal counts as a binding and disqualifies
    the name:

        query = "SELECT ..."          # once   -> resolved
        query = "A"; query = "B"      # twice  -> skipped, not "last wins"
        query += " WHERE x = :x"      # AugAssign is a binding -> skipped
        for query in (...)            # loop target -> skipped (and already
                                      #   handled properly by _loop_bound_sql)
        with x() as query:            # `with` target -> skipped
        def f(query): ...             # a PARAMETER is a binding -> skipped

    That last one matters most and is the easiest to forget: without counting
    parameters, a helper `async def run(sql)` that happens to contain
    `sql = "..."` in a branch would attribute that literal to every caller's
    statement. Resolving the wrong SQL is worse than resolving none — it reports
    defects against innocent lines and, worse, PASSES statements that were never
    examined.

    Scope discipline comes free from `_own_nodes`, which stops at nested
    functions: a `sql` in an inner function cannot leak out to an outer call
    site, or vice versa.
