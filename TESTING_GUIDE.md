echo "Test Business License Document" > business_license.pdf

# Upload document (replace TOKEN and merchant_id)
curl -X POST https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/merchants/1/documents/upload \

## üß™ API Testing (Alternative Method)

If frontend has issues, test backend directly:

### 1. Get Auth Token
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/auth/signin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "superadmin@pivota.com", "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD"}'

# Save the token from response
TOKEN="eyJ..."
```

### 2. Test Merchant Onboarding
```bash
curl -X POST https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/merchants/onboard \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "business_name": "Test Store",
    "legal_name": "Test Store Inc",
    "platform": "shopify",
    "store_url": "https://test.myshopify.com",
    "contact_email": "test@store.com",
    "contact_phone": "+1234567890",
    "business_type": "ecommerce",
    "country": "US",
    "expected_monthly_volume": 10000,
    "description": "Test merchant"
  }'
```

### 3. List Pending Merchants
```bash
curl https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/merchants/?status=pending \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### 4. Approve Merchant
```bash
curl -X POST https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/merchants/1/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### 5. Reject Merchant
```bash
curl -X POST https://pivota-dashboard.onrender.com/merchants/2/reject \

## ‚úÖ Expected Test Results

### Frontend Checklist:
- [ ] Modal opens when clicking "Onboard Merchant"
- [ ] Form accepts all required fields
- [ ] Submit shows success alert with merchant ID
- [ ] Merchant appears in list after refresh
- [ ] KYB Review modal opens with merchant details
- [ ] Approve button works and updates status
- [ ] Reject button works with reason input

### Backend Checklist:
- [ ] `/merchants/onboard` creates merchant record
- [ ] Database tables `merchants` and `kyb_documents` exist
- [ ] Document upload saves file to `uploads/kyb/{merchant_id}/`
- [ ] `/merchants/?status=pending` returns pending merchants
- [ ] Approve endpoint updates status to "approved"
- [ ] Reject endpoint updates status to "rejected"

### Database Verification (if accessible):
```sql

SELECT * FROM kyb_documents WHERE merchant_id = 1;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Modal Doesn't Open
**Check**: Browser console for errors
**Fix**: Refresh page, check if Vite HMR caused issues

### Issue 2: API Returns 401 Unauthorized
**Check**: Token in localStorage
**Fix**: Login again to refresh token

### Issue 3: Merchant Not Appearing in List
**Check**: Network tab ‚Üí API response
**Fix**: The merchants list might be from `/admin/merchants/kyb/status` (old endpoint) instead of `/merchants/` (new endpoint)

### Issue 4: File Upload Fails
**Check**: File size, backend logs
**Fix**: Ensure `uploads/kyb/` directory exists with write permissions

### Issue 5: Backend Not Deployed
**Check**: Render dashboard
**Fix**: Deploy latest code to Render

## üìä What to Check

After testing, verify:

1. **Database**:
   - Merchants table has records
   - Status transitions work (pending ‚Üí approved/rejected)
   - Documents are linked to merchants

2. **API**:
   - All endpoints respond correctly
   - Authentication works
   - Admin-only endpoints reject non-admins

3. **Frontend**:
   - Modals render properly
   - Forms submit successfully
   - Success/error messages display
   - Data refreshes after actions

---

## üöÄ Next Steps After Testing

Once testing confirms everything works:

1. **Deploy Backend** (if not already)
2. **Document any bugs found**
3. **Build Phase 2**: PSP Connection System
4. **Build Phase 3**: API Key Management
5. **Build Phase 4**: Webhook System
