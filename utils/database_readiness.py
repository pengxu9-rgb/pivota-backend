    `ensure_database_ready` (below), which reconnects and resets pool state
    before answering — so it reported the health of its own repair attempt,
    not what request handlers actually see.

    That cost 12.5 hours of production on 2026-08-05/06: startup had left the
    app in degraded mode (main.py keeps the service up when the initial
    connect fails), so every DB-backed request raised
    `AssertionError: DatabaseBackend is not running` and returned 500 —
    agent product search, promotions, all of it — while `/health` kept
    answering 200 because it reconnected each time it was asked. Railway's
    healthcheck points at `/health`, so nothing ever restarted the container,
    and background jobs (which call `database.connect()` with no timeout)
    hung holding their `max_instances=1` slots. The outage was total and
    invisible at the same time.

    So: this function connects nothing and resets nothing. If the shared
    `database` is not connected, that IS the answer, and the caller must
    report unhealthy so the platform can act. Request-time recovery is a
    separate concern and stays where it belongs — `ensure_database_ready`,
    still called by the auth/quote/order paths.
